// Write a method to swap two elements in an array.

var swap = function(/* Hmmm... I wonder what you need here...*/){

}

// What's the time complexity?
// Can you make it any better?


// --------------- Problem 3 ---------------

// Write a method to delete an element in an array.

var deleteElement = function(/*...*/){

}

// What's the time complexity?
// How can you make it more efficient
